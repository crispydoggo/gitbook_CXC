# 4.	CXC®’s profile {#section4}

The Caribbean Examination Council (CXC®) is an examination board active since 1972 under an agreement by 15 Commonwealth Caribbean countries (Agreement by the Participating Governments in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)). The organization was formed with the aim of transforming education in the Caribbean at a time when British examination boards were the leading examination bodies but also when countries in the region were asserting themselves as independent states or advocating for independence, therefore the necessity for internal regional examinations was born to shape future development. 

As of today, the Council has 16 English-speaking participating countries and three Dutch-speaking territories that offer examinations. The two main offices of the Council are the Headquarters or Eastern Zone Office (EZO) in Barbados and the Western Zone Office (WZO) in Jamaica.

CXC® provides examinations and certifications for secondary and post-secondary candidates in Caribbean countries in a variety of subjects in academic, technical, and vocational areas. The organization works with educators across the Caribbean who work in sixth form schools, community, state, and teacher-training colleges and universities, as well as specialists from the private sector.

CXC® also uses its expertise and technologies to provide assistance and consultancy services such as the development of syllabuses, preparation and administration of national examinations, training in school-based assessment, item writing, and other aspects of measurement and evaluation, analysis and preparation of reports of students’ performance, and preparation of resource materials for both the public and private sector across the region.

The vision of the institution is to be a digitally transformed enterprise that provides quality, relevant, and globally recognised educational services and its mission is to develop the human capital of Caribbean people through partnerships for global competitiveness.

The structure of the Council currently consists of the Vice-Chancellor of the University of West Indies, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Guyana, three representatives of the University of West Indies, one representative of the University of Guyana, two representatives appointed by each of the Participating Governments (Barbados, Jamaica, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago), one representative appointed by each of the other Participating Governments, and one representative of the teaching profession appointed by each National Committee from among its members. Members of the Council hold office for a period of three years and Chairmanship is held by one of the Vice-Chancellors or their representatives. The council meets annually to decide on policy framework, and this is carried out by the Administrative and Finance Committee (AFC), the School Examinations Committee (SEC), and its Sub-Committee (SUBSEC).

Other stakeholders are also important to support the organization and its mandates. At the national level, these stakeholders include Ministries of Education, CXC® National Committees, national education authorities, schools, post-secondary and tertiary education institutions, and employers. At the regional level, the stakeholders are the CARICOM Secretariat, OECS Commission, the Caribbean Development Bank, The University of the West Indies, Regional accreditation agencies, the Caribbean Union of Teachers, and regional commercial and employer bodies. Finally, at the international level, these include international development partners such as UNESCO, UNECLAC, UNICEF, UN-WEF, COL, IADB, EU and OAS, international universities and colleges, international examinations and assessment bodies, as well as international qualifications authorities and accreditation agencies and international awarding bodies.


## CXC®’s RBM profile

CXC® is considered an advanced results-oriented organisation among CARICOM’s Regional Institutions. As the regional examinations board, improving performance with learning is in its essence. It is an institution that, like many others, faces different challenges such as scarce resources, the COVID-19 pandemic, and a constant need to adapt to the changing needs of its customers. To face these challenges and keep delivering services of excellence in the region, CXC® has made relevant efforts into the adoption of an RBM System.


In 2020, CXC® created the Corporate Planning and Strategy Management Unit (CPSM). This unit oversees the institutional planning activities as well as the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the strategics’ medium-term plan. The development of CXC®’s Strategic Plan 2021 – 2025, a bold plan intended to guide the institution’s initiatives considering the regional needs with a global perspective, is another big step toward a systematic results-oriented approach. The Strategic Plan sets a clear general goal, becoming a globally recognized and top technological educational service provider, and 13 specific strategies to achieve this. All strategies have at least one key performance indicator (KPI), yearly targets, and responsible units or departments.

Another significant advance by CXC® was the adoption of the Spider Impact Software (SIS), a management tool that uses the Balance Scorecard methodology (BSC) to monitor the institution’s performance and keep track of the achievement of defined goals. The information captured by the system brings a deep insight into how the initiatives are performing, the budget expenditure, and how much on track CXC® is; and the analysis of this information allows to learn and improve performance. On the road to developing the institutional RBM System, CXC® is committed and motivated to continue the journey.
